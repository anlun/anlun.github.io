The Leaky Semicolon: Compositional Semantic Dependencies for Relaxed-Memory Concurrency
</h1>


<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
Program logics and semantics tell us that when executing (S1; S2) starting in state s0,
we execute S1 in s0 to arrive at s1, then execute S2 in s1 to
arrive at the final state s2.  This is, of course, an abstraction.  Processors
execute instructions out of order, due to pipelines and caches, and compilers
reorder programs even more dramatically.  All of this reordering is meant to
be unobservable in single-threaded code, but is observable in multi-threaded code.
A formal attempt to understand the resulting mess is known
as a ``relaxed memory model.''  The relaxed memory models that have been
proposed to date either fail to address sequential composition directly, overly
restrict processors and compilers, or permit nonsense thin-air behaviors which are
unobservable in practice.

To support sequential composition while targeting modern hardware, we propose
using preconditions and families of predicate transformers.  When composing
(S1;S2), the predicate transformers used to validate the preconditions of
events in S2 are chosen based on the semantic dependencies from events in
S1 to events in S2.  We apply this approach to two existing memory
models: ``Modular Relaxed Dependencies'' for C11 and ``Pomsets with
Preconditions.''
