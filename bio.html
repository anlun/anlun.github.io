Anton Podkopaev is the head of Programming Languages and Tools lab at JetBrains Research.
He was a postdoc at MPI-SWS and did his PhD at St. Petersburg University.
<br/> <br/>
Anton works on rigorous mathematical specifications and proofs for realistic concurrency systems including CPU architectures (e.g., x86, Arm, Power)
and languages (e.g., C/C++, Java, JavaScript).
His interests include proving compiler correctness, verifying of concurrent algorithms in weak memory models,
mechanizing proofs in interactive theorem provers, functional programming.
