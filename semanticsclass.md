This class aims to introduce basic concepts of programming language semantics.
The main ones presented in the class are following:
- Big-step operational semantics for the expression language.
- Big-step operational semantics for the language of statements.
- Small-step operational semantics for the language of statements.
- Hoare triples, axiomatic semantics for the language of statements.
