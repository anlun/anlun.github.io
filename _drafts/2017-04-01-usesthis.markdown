I've been a fan of [usesthis.com](http://usesthis.com) for quite a while.
A couple of days ago I decided that it's my time to write about my setup.
So here is my usesthis.com-like post!

# Who are you, and what do you do?
I'm Anton Podkopaev. Currently, I'm a PhD student @ [SPbU](http://spbu.ru) and
a researcher @ [JetBrains Research](http://research.jetbrains.org).
I study CS mostly in the area of formal methods, so I spend most of my time
writing proofs!

In my rare spare time I like to take pictures, pretending to do art.

# What hardware do you use?
My main machine is Dell XPS 13. I absolutely adore it for
being extremely light and compact, having a powerful enough CPU and long-lasting
battery.

I take pictures with Canon 50D.
It's a magnificient camera.
Even though, from time to time I think I need to buy a new lighter one.

My cell phone is Meizu M3s. The main advantages of it a metal case and
a modest price.

# And what software?
vim
emacs

# What would be your dream setup?
TODO
