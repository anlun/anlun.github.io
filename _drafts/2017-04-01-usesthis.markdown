I've been a fan of [usesthis.com](http://usesthis.com) for quite a while.
A couple of days ago I decided that it's my time to write about my setup.
So here is my usesthis.com-like post!

# Who are you, and what do you do?
I'm Anton Podkopaev. Currently, I'm a PhD student @ [SPbU](http://spbu.ru) and
a researcher @ [JetBrains Research](http://research.jetbrains.org).
I study CS mostly in the area of formal methods, so I spend most of my time
writing proofs!

In my rare spare time I like to take pictures, pretending to do art.

# What hardware do you use?
My main machine is Dell XPS 13. I absolutely adore it for
being extremely light and compact, having a powerful enough CPU and long-lasting
battery.

I take pictures with Canon 50D.
It's a magnificient camera.
Even though, from time to time I think I need to buy a new lighter one.

My cell phone is Meizu M3s. Its main advantages are a metal case and
a modest price (~200$ in Russia). It's quite durable as well--it's fallen
many times to different surfaces including asphalt and porcelain tiles
during the half of the year I've been using it, but it got only a couple of
minor scrapes on the case. Unfortunately, it runs some Chinese version
of Android, which causes some minor inconveniences, but it's totally compensated
by the price difference to Samsungs and iPhones.

There are some drawbacks like
a custom "OS" on top of Android and from time to time appering minor bugs.

# And what software?
vim
emacs

# What would be your dream setup?
TODO
